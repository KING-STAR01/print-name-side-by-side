print ur name side by side

this is a c program to print ur name side by side.

as of now only small letters only allowed.

capital and special characters are not allowed iam working for that change.

i wrote this program and checked in gcc compiler so iam not sure that all compilers accept this code.

to run the program

simply compile the c programm.

run a.out file.

and enter ur name.

example:

prasanth
